Pets plugin for MCPE Server. Work with ImagicalMine, PocketMine-MP and Genisys.

- All kinds of animal (Ocelot, Wolf, .... ) (need supportive for Entity)

- Pets followed you!

- Supportive on Economy (maybe?)

- Subcommand support (will add soon!)

- Name your Pets :)
 
- Command: /pets

- This plugin is taken from LbCore, and a little fix to standalone public plugin!
